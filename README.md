Explanation of the Structure:
1. assets/
This folder contains all the media files required for the game:
bird.png — an image of the bird that will fly across the screen.
pipe.png — an image of the pipes that the player needs to avoid.
sky.png — background image for the game.
Other images for background elements, buttons, etc.

2. src/
This is the main part of the project containing all the game logic:
scenes/ — a folder containing files, each corresponding to a game scene:
BaseScene.js — the base scene responsible for game setup and initialization.
MenuScene.js — the main menu scene where the player can start a new game or adjust settings.
PauseScene.js — the pause scene where the player can pause the game.
PlayScene.js — the scene that handles the core gameplay.
PreloadScene.js — the scene where resources like images and sounds are preloaded.
ScoreScene.js — the scene displaying the score after the game ends.
index.js — the entry point for the game, initializing scenes and launching the game.
game.js — file containing Phaser game configuration and settings.

3. dist/
The folder where the generated files are placed after building the project:
index.html — the main HTML file used to run the game.
vendor.js — the compiled file with external libraries and dependencies.
app.js — the main JavaScript file containing all the game logic, bundled by Webpack.
Other generated files after running the build command (e.g., via npm run build).

4. node_modules/
This folder contains all the dependencies installed through npm, such as Phaser 3 and other libraries.

5. .gitignore
This file specifies which files and folders should not be committed to the repository (e.g., node_modules, dist).

6. package.json
The npm configuration file that contains all the dependencies, scripts for running (e.g., for building or deploying the game), and other project metadata.

7. package-lock.json
A file that locks the specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

8. webpack.config.js
Configuration file for Webpack, which handles the bundling of the project. It configures Webpack to process JavaScript files, images, and other assets.

9. README.md
Documentation for users and developers that explains how to run the project, the tools used, and other important details.

Workflow of the Project:
index.js — this is the entry point of the game where Phaser is initialized. It also sets up the different game scenes.
In each scene, the logic is handled:
In PreloadScene, all resources (graphics, sounds) are loaded.
In MenuScene, the user can select options (start the game, settings).
In PlayScene, the core gameplay happens.
In ScoreScene, the final score is shown after the game ends.
webpack.config.js bundles all the files into a single bundle (including resources), making the game more efficient and ready for deployment.
After building the project, the files are placed in dist/, where the game can be launched or deployed.

Conclusion:
The project is well-structured, with all resources and scenes organized into separate folders. 
The built project can be deployed on a platform like GitHub Pages, making the game accessible in the browser. 
Phaser 3 allows the development of an interactive and dynamic game with smooth physics and animations.
